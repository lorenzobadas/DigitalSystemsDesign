# Clock with integrated alarm
We want to implement a clock with an integrated alarm with four control buttons:
- MODE: switches between clock and alarm modes
- HH: increases hours count
- MM: increases minutes count
- SWITCH: turns on/off the alarm

Time is displayed on four seven-segments displays. In clock mode the DP segment blinks every second, while in alarm mode it stays on.
