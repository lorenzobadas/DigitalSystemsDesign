# Button controlled counter with de-bounce FSM
## Description
Display a counter on the 8 seven-segment displays on the Xilinx Nexys A7 board controlled by a button on the board.  
The most important lessons of this project are the Finite State Machine to be designed to prevent that at every button push the counter goes up by more than one push consequently to the bouncing effect of the button, and the Binary Coded Decimal counter module.
